Pokemon FireRed Randomizer 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to note before use: 
- You must have a CLEAN FireRed (USA) ROM to use the application - It will not save over your clean ROM but backups are recommended.
- This application was tested using mGBA but should theoretically work on any GBA emulator.  
- This application was developed using Java, thus you may need Java installed as well 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting Started:
1. Boot up the application 
2. Hit "Open ROM File" on the left 
3. Find your CLEAN ROM 
4. Select your randomization preferences
5. The "Summary" Tab will show what is going to be changed 
6. When you've selected everything, hit "Randomize ROM File" 
7. Choose where you'd like to save your randomized ROM and give it a name 
8. Load the new file in your emulator and enjoy :) 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting the ROM:
1. Follow this link https://archive.org/download/No-Intro-Collection_2016-01-03_Fixed - (note from Simon: I've used this link to get ROMs for the last two years and can vouch for the safety and integrity of these files) 
2. Scroll through the list and find "Nintendo - Gameboy Advanced.zip and click "View Contents" (if you click the main link it will download EVERYTHING... I don't recommend that)
3. Scroll through the massive list of ROMs until you find Pokemon FireRed Version (USA).zip
4. Click that and it will instantly start downloading 
5. Once downloaded, find the .zip file in your file browser and extract the file to where ever you wish it
6. Inside the extracted file should be a .gba file of the same or similar name, that is the ROM and what you will use for the application

Getting mGBA (optional):
1. Follow this link https://mgba.io/ or you can google mGBA and it should be the first link 
2. Go to the "Downloads" section in the upper right 
3. Here you'll find download links for different operating systems
4. You can download either the installer or the .7z file, the .7z file is an archive so it wont directly install anything to your computer
5. To extract a .7z file, you need an archive extraction tool called .7zip which can be found here: https://www.7-zip.org/ - 7zip functions similar to things like WinRAR and is used to extract and create archives for files 
6. Once extracted or installed, inside the folder you'll find a few different files, the emulator itself is the file titled "mGBA" and should have a small purple icon
