Pokemon FireRed Randomizer 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Things to note before use: 
- You must have a clean FireRed (USA) ROM to use the application - It will not save over your clean ROM but backups are recommended.
- This application was tested using mGBA but should theoretically work on any GBA emulator.  
- This application was developed using Java, thus you may need Java installed as well
